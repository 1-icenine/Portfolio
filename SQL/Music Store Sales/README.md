# 🎵 Spotify Data Exploration with SQL

## 📌 Overview

This project uses SQL to analyze data from the [Chinook sample database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database), which simulates a digital music store. The goal is to explore purchasing trends and sales performance to answer key business questions about genre popularity, album recommendations, employee performance, and regional sales patterns.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Used **CTEs** (Common Table Expressions) for cleaner query logic
- Applied **window functions** like `DENSE_RANK()` for ranking
- Performed **sanity checks** to confirm data accuracy
- Created **SQL views** for reusability and modularity

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage
1. Load the Chinook database in your SQL environment
2. Open and run `EDA_Music_Store.sql`.
3. View outputs from each section to explore insights.

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored
1. Which genres are most popular in the U.S. market?
2. Which albums from the top 3 genres in the U.S. should be promoted?
3. Which sales employees performed best?
4. Which countries generate the most revenue?
5. What are the average order values and spending per customer by country?
